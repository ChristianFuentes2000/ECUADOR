<p class="parrafo"> The Galapagos Islands originated from lava eruptions that came from the bottom of the ocean and rose to 2,600 feet above sea level. Some of the younger islands still have active volcanoes. Different characters, such as the isolation, the climate, the altitude and the texture of the land on the islands have made their vegetation different and the animal life unique in the world. However Galapagos is not just about animals and plants. There are a large number of shops, museums, art galleries, bars, clubs, restaurants and hotels that provide even pure fun and entertainment.</p>
