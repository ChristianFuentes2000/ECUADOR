<p class="parrafo">The Chimborazo, with its towering 20,560 feet high above the coastal lands on one side, and over the Amazon rainforest on the other, the Chimborazo is the highest peak in Ecuador and the seventeenth in the world. A curiosity about Chimborazo is that its top is the farthest point on the earth's surface with respect to the center of the planet. The upper part of Mount Chimborazo is completely covered by glaciers, with arms to the northeast that descend to 4,600 meters above sea level. Its glacier is the source of water for the population of the Ecuadorian provinces of Bol√≠var and Chimborazo.</p>

<p class="parrafo">The Quilotoa is a volcano, within its crater a caldera with a diameter of almost 9 km was formed. This is the product of the collapse of the volcano, which occurred more than 800 years ago. According to studies, the volcanic flow managed to reach the Pacific Ocean.

In the 250 m deep caldera, a lagoon has formed. The minerals have given the surface a greenish and bluish hue when it is hit by sunlight. Inside, there are springs that from the shore, can be perceived as bubbling trails that rise to the surface.</p>
